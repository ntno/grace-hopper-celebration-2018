### problem
* traditional GPS is not accurate enough for use cases like autonomous vehicles - even a meter in error is too much
* error is introduced through atmospheric conditions which can change by location, time of day, weather
  * tropospheric
  * iosspheric (?)

DGPS (Differental GPS) 
* +- 1 meter
* 4 satellites minimum
* rover must be 100-200 km from base station

RTK (Real Time Kinematic) 
* +- 2 cm
* 5 satellites minimum
* rover must be 10-20 km from base station

base station
* located at a known longitude, lattitude, altitude  
* broadcasts correction info
